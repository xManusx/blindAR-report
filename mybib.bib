abstract="Project Google Glass represents the innovative technology developed by Google's X Lab. This smart gadget is built on human interaction with world through Android operating system. Wearable computer with the optical head-mounted display (abbreviated as OHMD) has been developing by Google. Firstly, the primary purpose of Project Google Glass was the hands-free displaying of knowledge presently obtainable to most sensible mobile phone users. Secondly, Google Glass (abbreviated as GG) was allowing interaction with the Internet and the web via basic voice or vision commands. In a basic view, Google Glasses are wearable computers that can easily power mobile devices such as Smartphones or tablets. This paper is focused on the practical utilization of Google Glass for sensually impaired people (in this case it means blind or visually impaired people). Google Glass is easily programmable and helpful technology that can significantly help people, not only the handicapped or impaired individuals, but their benefits can also make easier life for elderly people. Primary purpose of the paper is to provide and test developed application for basic navigation issues, which are usable for daily support of blind or visually impaired people. Second part of research is using Google Glass camera as a basic recognition tool for blind or visually impaired individuals. In this point of view it is possible to call GG as Assistive Technology or device, which helps blind people or people with visual impairment too. Google Glass are currently often used in various domains such as medicine, research, education.",
