\begin{abstract}

The abstract summarizes your complete project and is the last thing that you write. That means that the reader can find parts of the introduction, methods, results, discussion and outlook in roughly 200 words. After the reader is finished with the abstract he/she must be eager to read the complete article. \\
The abstract can start with a fact that no one can challenge like ``cats are nice animals''. Then you define a problem in this context like ``However, cats smell''. You go on with introducing your way of solving this problem like ``we used shampoo to solve this problem'' and also mention the most striking result like "we were able to make 89~\% of our test cats odorant''. You finish with an outlook and advertise your work like ``the idea of washing cats can be a first step of significantly improving the relation of cats and humans''. \\
The abstract is mainly written in simple past, present tense is only used in facts you are absolutely sure about.
