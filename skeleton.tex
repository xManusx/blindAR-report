\section{Methods}
In the following, we will present the different parts of our system, used algorithms and third-party libraries.


\subsection{Platform and Development Environment}
\label{subsec:sucks}
As  hardware platform we decided to use the Microsoft HoloLens as it is hands-free and does not obstruct the users from their normal tasks.
It offers information about the spatial surroundings of the user via so called \enquote{Spatial Mapping} (see \Cref{subsec:spatial}) and an easy to use speech \ac{io} system via Microsoft's Cortana (see \Cref{subsec:ui}).
Our intention for using the HoloLens was developing a proof-of-concept on a device that offers everything we need (see the following sections) and more.
As the HoloLens is 	quite expensive, our system was not intended to be released as a ready-to-use product or for general use.
Hence, the high price of the HoloLens is not an issue.

We started developing with Unity (Unity Technologies, San Francisco, USA), as advised by the hardware manufacturer Microsoft, which is supposed to provide an  easy start into augmented reality development.
However, we could not get needed libraries like OpenCV to work when developing with Unity, which made us switch to developing directly with DirectX and Microsoft Visual Studio 2017.

\subsection{Marker Detection}
\label{subsec:markers}
To begin a successful interaction with any touchscreen, obviously the system first has to detect if a touchscreen is present.
This is not a trivial problem.
Touchscreens are hard to detect as reflections may occur, lighting and brightness conditions may vary and with screen content being notoriously non-static.

%\begin{figure}[thpb]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=0.99\columnwidth]{markers.png}
%\caption{Possible markers for the HoloLensARToolKit \cite{artoolkit}, similar markers are used with ArUco \cite{aruco}}
%\label{fig:markers}
%\end{figure}

Thus, we decided to use a marker-based approach to touchscreen detection, where users are required to put markers next to touchscreens.
This places a small burden of initially placing the markers on users---which we believe is acceptable---but drastically reduces the complexity of touchscreen detection.

Because we faced technical problems with using either the HoloLensARToolKit \cite{artoolkit}  or the OpenCV marker detection module ArUco \cite{aruco}, we decided to implement our own marker detection pipeline using OpenCV.
\acused{api}
We used the webcam stream, readily available via the HoloLens \ac{api}.
First, we applied grayscaling, then regular and Otsu thresholding, and finally a difference edge detector, which leaves us with \autoref{fig:finalmarker}.
To further process the marker, the warped and twisted marker image from \autoref{fig:markerdetection} had to be transformed into a quadratic form.
Then a $5\times5$ grid could be overlaid, creating a grid representation of the marker image, allowing the encoded data to be read from the marker.
The data was represented as an unsigned integer -- a unique ID, identifying the exact device, e.g.\ coffee machine X by manufacturer Y.

\begin{figure}[thpb]

		\caption{Image after applying a difference edge detector} \label{fig:finalmarker}
	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{Visualisation of marker detection pipeline steps}
	\label{fig:markerdetection}
\end{figure}

The complete data on devices then could be loaded, either from local storage (as in  our case a \texttt{.json} file) or theoretically also from a remote database\footnote{which could be community maintained/crowdsourced}.
Data includes the screen size and the position and size of each (touch-)button with an appropriate string describing the button (e.g.\ \enquote*{a}, \enquote*{b}, \dots{} for a virtual keyboard or \enquote{Espresso}, \enquote{Cappuccino},~\dots{} for buttons on a coffee machine).
This button layout is saved for each possible screen layout that can be shown by the touch screen.
At this point  the system knows about the existence of a touch screen in its vicinity and the possible screen contents that can be shown.
To determine which of many possible screens is shown at one time and create a virtual, blind-friendly representation, \ac{ocr} is used.

\subsection{Optical Character Recognition}
\label{subsec:ocr}
\ac{ocr} is needed to  to determine which screen content is actually shown and to determine if button presses were successful.
For this task, we used the Microsoft \ac{ocr} Library for Windows Runtime.
Besides 19 other languages, it is able to excellently recognize German and English, which were the main languages we focused on.

The text returned from the \ac{ocr} then was compared with the text of buttons stored in the screen layouts. 
Using minimal edit distance  -- to account for possible recognition errors -- as a comparison metric, we were able to determine the current screen layout.
For optimal, error free interaction with the touch screen device, the system needs to know the exact position and orientation of the touch screen in the 3D space around the user.
This is accomplished using the \emph{Spatial Mapping} provided by the HoloLens.

\subsection{Spatial Mapping}
\label{subsec:spatial}
According to the \textcite{spatialmapping}, spatial mapping provides \enquote{a detailed representation of real-world surfaces in the environment around the HoloLens}.
For this task, the HoloLens is equipped with two cameras in the center of the forehead, which use Time-of-Flight to estimate the distance to objects and surfaces around the user. 
The spatial mapping \ac{api} returns \emph{spatial surfaces}, represented as a triangle mesh.
A visualisation of such a mesh can be seen in \Cref{fig:spatialmesh}.

\begin{figure}[thpb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{spatialmapping.jpg}
	\caption{Visualisation of a spatial mesh \cite{spatialmapping}}
	\label{fig:spatialmesh}
\end{figure}

Using raycasting, we were able to find the position of the markers on the spatial surface.
Combined with the information from the touch screen database (size of screen, position of buttons, \dots) this allowed us to construct a \enquote{virtual touchscreen} consisting of virtual cubes and cuboids, accurately aligned with the corresponding real world touch screen buttons, \emph{in front} of the actual touch screen, which the user then can interact with (see \Cref{subsec:ui}).


\subsection{Finger Tracking}
\label{subsec:finger}
For both modes  of interaction, an accurate position of the user's finger is needed.
The HoloLens \ac{api} could give us the position of the center of the user's  back of the hand.
Thus, we had to find a different means of tracking the user's finger.

The Leap Motion (Leap Motion Inc., San Francisco, USA) seemed to be promising and delivered formidable results with regards to accuracy and ease of use.
However, it had the big drawback of needing a permanent cable connection to a full-fletched PC which was too much of a burden on the usability of the system to continue using it.

Our first own approach was to just use the HoloLens \ac{api} provided hand position and add a static offset to it.
This proved accurate enough for testing but not for real world deployments:
What if -- for example -- a user has really small hands or keeps their hand in an unexpected position?

Again our fallback solution was OpenCV.
We wrapped the user's fingertip with a colored tap (e.g.\ red, green or blue), then filtered the webcam stream for that color, mapped that dot into 3D space and thus had a reliable and accurate finger position.
One possible usability improvement would be to filter the webcam stream for the user's skin color and use this for finger tracking.
This already has been done by \textcite{fingertips}, but we did not reimplement his solution.


\subsection{Speech Input and Output and User Interface}
\label{subsec:ui}
\label{subsec:voiceio}
For speech \ac{io}, we decided to use Microsoft's Cortana as it was readily available via it's easy to use \ac{api}.
If a supported touch screen device was detected in the user's vicinity, its presence was indicated to the user, who subsequently could choose between two modes of interaction: the \emph{verbose} mode and the \emph{normal} mode.

\subsubsection{The verbose mode}
The user announced to the system that they wished to use the touch screen via a voice command.
Then the system read out all the information shown on the touch screen to the user.
Via voice command the user selected one button they wished to press.
The system guided the user's finger to the selected button via \enquote{spatial beeping}.

The HoloLens offers a spatial sound \ac{api}, allowing developers to seemingly play sounds as they were coming from specified 3D coordinates around the user.
Combined with a beeping sound that varies in beeping frequency proportional to the finger's distance to the selected button (similar to how parking assistance systems work), effectively allowing the user to quickly move their finger to the button's position.

\subsubsection{The normal mode}
The normal mode was meant for users that  are already familiar with some devices around them.
When a touch screen's presence was indicated to the users, they could chose to not engage the system via a voice command but instead just hover their finger over the touch screen.
If the finger collided with a button of the virtual touchscreen -- consisting of cuboids floating in front of the real touch screen -- that buttons text was read out.
This allowed for much quicker interactions.

\begin{comment}
This section includes everything the reader needs to understand your system and results. Things you just used only have to be mentioned and cited. For data recording, we used the mobile system developed by Kugler et al.
%\cite{ProceedingsArticle}.
Make sure to describe your contribution as short and precise as possible and as detailed as needed to reimplement it. You have to include a description of data, hardware, math, algorithms, system structure and evaluation methods and everything that was important to solve the defined problem. Make sure to order the methods so that the reader can follow your description. First things first! Make sure to structure the methods in a proper way. Use a dry description and try not to teach the reader. \\
The methods part is written in simple past, even if you created a live system that can still do things. It is only important what the system did on the data you presented. Only describe the best and final version of the system. The reader is not interested what you did wrong in developing the final system. Things that did not work don't have to be mentioned.

	\subsection{Structure}
	A rule of thumb is that you describe one fact in each paragraph. That means, if you go to the next aspect, you start with a new paragraph. Try to maintain a logical structure throughout the paper where paragraphs build upon each other.\\
	A good way to structure the paper are subsections. You can also use enumerations to structure the paper. Use an unordered list if the items don't have a structure.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Apple
		\item Peach
		\item Melon
		\item Grape
	\end{itemize}
	Use an ordered list if there is a hierarchical structure in the list.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Erlangen
		\item Bavaria
		\item Germany
		\item Europe
	\end{enumerate}
	You should always have more than one subsection. Otherwise the structure does not make sense.

	\subsection{Figures, equations and tables}
	Add figures and cite the figures at the end of a sentence (Fig.~\ref{einstein}). Good figures make a paper a lot better. Don't use figures if they are of bad quality or not exactly what you want to show with it. Latex puts figures where they fit best regarding the document structure. Often, figures are not at the same place as they are defined in the source code. Don't worry too much about that. Often, they are place on top of a page but the desired (not defined) positioning can be specified in the brackets after begin\{figure\}. Make sure the figure is readable when printed in black and white. This means that the lines in a plot have to be of different shape (dotted, dashed,\dots) and the coloring has to be adapted if used. Print the paper in black and white if unsure.\\
	Add important equations that a relevant for understanding your system and cite them (Eq.~\ref{einstein}). Every variable has to be explained. The variable $f$ denotes the force, $m$ the mass and $c$ a constant. Make sure to reference the equation or provide an explanation. When writing about value make sure to insert a safe blank between value and unit like 9.81~g or 67~\% to avoid a line break between value and unit. The safe blank is also needed when referencing figures.

	\begin{equation}
		f = m \times c^2
		\label{einstein}
	\end{equation}

	\subsection{Proper use of language}
	Make sure to use proper English in your papers. Get the paper reviewed by another person to avoid stupid typos and check the language for common mistakes. If the paper is important, try to find a native speaker for review. Some common language related problems:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Make sure to use lower case for nouns.
		\item There are no strict rules for punctuation in English and, in some cases, the rules are different to German rules. One common problem is the use of a comma in a relative clause. There is no comma after ``that'' and ``which'' if it is a restrictive relative clause like ``The book which I read is well written.''. There is a comma if it is a non-restrictive relative clause like ``That book, which incidentally I just finished reading, is well written.''. A rule of thumb is that you use a comma if the relative sentence is not needed to make it a proper sentence.
		\item Use short sentence in paratactic form. This is easier to read. Long sentences are hard to understand. You don't write poems that are supposed to be of nice language.
		\item You can alternate between active and passive. Contrary to German, the use of active is also elegant. When talking about yourself you should write ``the author'' or ``we''. 
		\item Do not abbreviate terms like ``do not'', ``cannot'' or ``it is''.
		\item Find scientific synonyms for colloquial language. You can start colloquial and then transform into scientific language afterwards. If you are unsure how to start you can use a phrasebank 
			%	\cite{Phrasebank}
			to copy nice formulations.
		\item If you are not sure if you found the right word in a dictionary use a single language dictionary like %\cite{Weblink}.
		\item Numbers: write words when referring to numerals below ten, referring to fractions, referring to approximate numbers and at the beginning of a sentence. Use figures when referring to sets of numbers, numbers including decimal points and when referring to pages. Make sure to use a decimal point instead of a comma as in German. 
		\item	Get yourself inspired from the literature. Use nice formulations from other papers. Never copy words but copy style.  
	\end{itemize} 
	It is very important to be consistently in wording and punctuation. Call the same things with the same name even if you think that it is boring. Use the same punctuation rule throughout the complete paper. 

\subsection{Template and length}
You should always avoid to change the template. It was created for a good reason. If your manuscript is too long you should change the content and not the template. Concentrate on the purpose of your project and get rid of side aspects. Use references and keep work of others short. You HAVE to learn to describe your work in a given length. A rule of thumb is a partitioning of 15 \% (Introduction), 40 \% (Methods), 10 \% (Results), 25 \% (Discussion) and 10 \% (Summary and outlook).

\subsection{Source code and devices}
Normally, you don't present source code. The reader is more interested in a flow chart to understand how your algorithm works.  Describe the most important steps of algorithms in detail and briefly describe other parts. Always provide a version when referring to other software packages or libraries. 
If you talk devices like smart phones or treadmills provide the manufacturer and the companies headwater details like (Google Inc., Mountain View, USA).

%Results
\section{Results}
We tried to validate our system by doing a small user study, recruiting the subjects from the \ac{bbsb}, the Bavarian society for the visually impaired.
We contacted them and first sent out a short survey, asking them about their use of assistive technologies and impairments they face in everyday life.
The answer confirmed what we were already suspecting: that touch screens are a major issue for them, due to their totally non-tactile feedback.
They also were -- more or less -- interested in the use of new assistive technologies, but feared that this could be cost intensive.
This also confirmed our  intention of implementing the system on the Microsoft HoloLens only as a proof-of-concept, not intended for general use, as the final product might have to be not as expensive as the HoloLens to be adapted by the community.

Unfortunately, we did not manage to do the planned user study, hence no results can be presented from that.
This might be an interesting task for future researchers, evaluating the usability of our \ac{ui}.

\begin{comment}
You describe the pure results in this section. Performance measures, reference system and experimental setup have to be explained in the methods part. Don't provide an interpretation of the results in this section, just talk about the results. Don't provide reasons why your system didn't work in this or that condition. Just mention that this was the case. Quantitative results are most striking and you might want to sum them up in a table (Tab.~\ref{result_table}). If you have a lot of different results, pick the best and most important ones. Focus on the purpose of your system! You can use the same structure as in the methods section if appropriate.\\
The result section is written in simple past. Even if you have a live system, you describe the results as achieved in the evaluation.

%Discussion
\section{Discussion and Outlook}
Our system tries to solve one of the many obstacles blind and visually impaired people face in everyday life.
The ubiquity of touchscreens nowadays especially poses a problem for blind people, as touch screens do not give tactile feedback and most devices\footnote{the exception being \acp{atm} and similar \enquote{official} devices} do not implement different \acp{ui}.

We developed a system design and implemented each part of the system separately, showing that each part is functionally viable.
For our first prototype, we only had two supported touch screens of which only one -- a fictional coffee machine, implemented on an Android Tablet -- was functional.
We also had to use a simplified marker detection algorithm, based on simple colored squares, similar to the finger tracking approach based on coloring the fingertip, as we could not get the marker detection algorithm to properly work in time.

After switching the development environment from Unity to Visual Studio, a big part of the HoloLens development ecosystem and the Unity physics engine (which includes the raycasting) was not available to us anymore and the documentation for developing holographic apps with DirectX was incomplete at best.
This resulted in us implementing our own, simplified raycasting, which could not use the spatial mapping data of the HoloLens.

Future researchers who want to continue working on this project should either port OpenCV to Unity and thus gain access to both OpenCV \emph{and} the HoloLens and Unity ecosystem or implement their own low-level processing of spatial mapping data and raycasting. Both tasks do not seem trivial and will require both a lot of time and knowledge of the developing team.


\begin{comment}
Begin with a short problem specific summary. Discuss every aspect from the result section and give an interpretation of the results. You can use the same structure as in the results. Why is the algorithm so good/bad? What are limitations or assumptions? What was remarkable in the project and can be seen in the data. Make sure to cite the literature when comparing to existing systems or algorithms. Always mention pros and cons! Discuss global strength and weakness and concentrate on major aspects.\\
The discussion is mainly written in simple past. You can use present tense when talking about facts that you are absolutely sure about. If you are very self confident, you can deduce facts from your findings but often conditional formulations are more polite. Sometimes it is better to combine the discussion with an outlook so you might want to use future as well. 

%Discussion
\section{Summary and outlook}
Sum up the most important project findings and mention what the next steps, improvements, enhancements could be. The outlook can consist of ideas that will be hard to realize. Don't just think about tomorrow, think about the next ten years. You can finish with advertising your work and point out the most important finding or development again.\\
The summary part is written in simple past. The outlook is written in present tense or future.
